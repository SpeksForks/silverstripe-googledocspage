#SilverStripe Google Docs Page

_by Title Web Solutions/Anselm Christophersen_

A page type that imports content from Google Docs


## NOTE

In August 2014 a request for Google Docs support for SilverStripe had been raised [here](http://silverstripe.uservoice.com/forums/251266-new-features/suggestions/6240888-google-docs-support). I remembered that I had been developing a page that can import from Google Docs back in 2010. I'm now posting it online to be used by the community. I was developed for SilverStripe 2.3, but - if Google's APIs haven't changed - it should work only with minor tweaks on the latest SilverStripe 3.x.    
If you need help with this, we can offer paid support. Please contact us through <http://www.title.dk>.
